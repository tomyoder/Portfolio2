      <div><h2>About me</h2>
      <p class="intro">I started playing the trombone when I was nine and it has really shaped most of my life.</p>
      <p class="second">I have a band <a href="http://www.howthingsworkband.com/">How Things Work</a>, which is an indie rock band with:
        <h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A Singer</li>
          <li>Drums</li>
          <li>Bass</li>
          <li>and <em><strong>two horns</strong></em> (Baritone Sax and Trombone)</li>
        </h3>
        </ul>
      <p class="extra"><em>instead</em> of the usual guitar.
      </p>
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p class="intro">Trying to make a living as a trombonist meant I had to pick up a lot of other skills in order to pay the rent.
      </p>
      <p class="second">I've spent the last twenty years working as a:
      </p>
      <h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Welder</li>
          <li>Machinist</li>
          <li>Mechanic</li>
        </ol>
      </h3>
      <p class="second">as well as <strong>recording location sound</strong> for film.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <p class="second">Playing the trombone in rock bands meant I had to build my own gear. If you play a guitar, and you need an amp or something, you go to Guitar Center. <em>There is no Trombone Center</em>. I built my own amps and equipment so I could go onstage and plug in and play through a stack like any self-respecting guitarist. The photo above is of a microphone I made that goes to a preamp system that gives a proper signal to the club sound board from both horns. I love building this stuff, almost as much as playing the horn.</p>

        <p class="intro"><strong>This emphasais on function, design, and construction is what led me to pursue programming. I am very interested in the underlying structure of software and how the machine actually works.</strong></p>
