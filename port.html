      <div><h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I started playing the trombone when I was nine and it has really shaped most of my life. I have a band <a href="http://www.howthingsworkband.com/">How Things Work</a>, which is an indie rock band with:
        <ul>
          <li>A Singer</li>
          <li>Drums</li>
          <li>Bass</li>
          <li>and <em><strong>two horns</strong></em> (Baritone Sax and Trombone)</li>
        </ul>instead of the usual guitar.</p>
      <div><p>Trying to make a living as a trombonist meant I had to pick up a lot of other skills in order to pay the rent. I've spent the last twenty years working as a
        <ol>
          <li>Welder</li>
          <li>Machinist</li>
          <li>Mechanic</li>
        </ol>
           as well as <strong>recording location sound</strong> for film.</p>
      </div>
      <div><p>Playing the trombone in rock bands meant I had to build my own gear. If you play a guitar, you go to Guitar Center. <em>There is no Trombone Center</em>. I built my own amps and equipment so I could go onstage and plug in and play through a stack like any self-respecting guitarist. The photo above is of a microphone I made that goes to a preamp system that gives a proper signal to the club sound board from both horns. I love building this stuff, almost as much as playing the horn.</p>
